For example, if you have two vectors X and Y, then, pearson(X, Y) == pearson(X, 2 \\* Y + 3). This is a pretty important property in recommendation systems because, for example, two users might rate two series of items totally differently in terms of absolute rates, but they would be similar users (i.e. with similar ideas) with similar rates in various scales .\n","\n","$$ \n","r = \\frac\n","  {\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i -
